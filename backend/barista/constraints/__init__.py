"""
This package groups some additional constraints required for the Barista program.

Those constraints might not be required to create valid caffe protoxt files, but they are required for the Barista
program due to whatever.
Depending on the subpackages, the included constraints need to be ensured permanently or only at specific times during
runtime.
